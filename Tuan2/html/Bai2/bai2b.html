    <h1><b>Leonhard Euler(1707-1783)
        </b></h1>
    <p>The greatst mathematicica of the eighteenth century <b>Leonhard Euler</b> was born in Basel,swizerland.There,hhe studied under anothe giant of mathematics,<b>Jean Bernoulli</b>.In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics and mathematics at St.Petetsburg
        Academy of Sciences.Euler was the most prolife mathematician off all time publishing over 800 different books and papers.His influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well.Euler's work on mathematical analysis introduction in analysin infinitrorum(1748)remained
        a standard textblook for well over a century.
        <p>one can hardly do math without copying Euler.Notations still in use today,such as e and pi,were introduced in Euler's weitings.He is perhaps best known for his research into mathematical analysis. cos(X)+isin(x)=e

        <p>one can hardly do math without copying Euler.Notations still in use today,such as e and pi,were introduced in Euler's weitings.He is perhaps best known for his research into mathematical analysis. cos(X)+isin(x)=e demonstrates the relationship
            betwen algebra complex analysis and trigonometry fromthis equation
            <p>e(i)+1=0</p>
            <p>which relates the fundamentnal constants :0,1,e and in a singgle beautiful and elegant statemen table</p>
            <p>Leonhard Euler died in 1783 leaving behind a legacry perhaps unmatched and certainly unsurpassed in the annals of mathematics</p>
